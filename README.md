# datasceiencejourney
A collection of projects throughout my data science journey

1) TwitterMLClassification - Sentiment analysis of ~1.5m tweets using PySpark. The notebook can be run locally if you a installation of Apache Spark on your machine. The one that I have uploaded here was run on a GPU cluster in Databricks.

2) nn_digit_recognizer - A simple Neural Network model to recognize hand written digits. The code is reproduced from Francois Chollets book "Deep Learning with Python". As I delve deeper into the book I will update the code and models as necessary.
